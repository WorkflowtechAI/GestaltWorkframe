"""The portable single-shot LLM interface.

This is the narrow contract that travels between layers: a system prompt and a
user prompt in, a string out. The platform's richer multi-turn, tool-calling

middleware and any module-side generation depend on, so they stay free of SDKs
and provider runtimes.

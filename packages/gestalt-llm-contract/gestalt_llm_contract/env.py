"""Canonical environment-variable names for the Gestalt LLM provider contract.

Both the GestaltWorkframe platform and the GestaltWorkframeEDU middleware
resolve their LLM provider from the same set of environment variables, in the
same precedence (OpenRouter, then a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with an
optional Anthropic fallback). These constants are the single source of truth so
the two layers cannot drift apart on the names or defaults.

# `CLAUDE_MODEL` while this contract declared `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, so an operator

# here so neither layer can drift away from it again.

# --- defaults ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Endpoints have defaults. MODELS DO NOT, and this package ships none.
#
# A model id written into a shared package is the worst version of a stale
# constant: it propagates to every consumer at once and can only be corrected by
# releasing the package. Both of the previous defaults proved the point.
#
#   DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_MODEL was "openrouter/auto", a router pseudo-model.
#   docs/standards/model-routing-policy.md excludes those outright: they are not
#   selectable models, they delegate the routing decision away from the lane,
#   and they publish sentinel prices (0 and -1 per token) that win any cost
#   ranking. Every consumer that did not set OPENROUTER_MODEL was handing model
#   choice to the aggregator while a lane resolver sat unused in the same repo.
#
#   DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_MODEL was "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest". Claude 3.5 Sonnet
#   was retired 2025-10-28 and both dated snapshots are gone, so the `-latest`
#   alias resolves to nothing and every request on that default returns HTTP 404
#   not_found_error. It was not merely stale, it was broken, in a package that
#   propagates to every consumer simultaneously.
#
# The replacement is no default at all. On the OpenRouter path the model is
# resolved at runtime from the live catalog by the lane system
# (gestaltworkframe/core/model_resolver.py). On the Anthropic fallback path the
# operator names the model explicitly via ANTHROPIC_MODEL (or its CLAUDE_MODEL
# alias); when nothing is named the fallback reports itself as not enabled
# rather than dispatching to a guess.

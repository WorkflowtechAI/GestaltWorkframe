# Gestalt Filesystem Connector

Walks a local, mounted NFS, or Windows UNC-accessible tree and emits canonical
documents. Hidden files and common build-output directories are skipped by
default. Polling-based change detection and full-walk reconciliation hooks ship
with the connector; OS-native watcher backends can be layered behind the same
interfaces later.

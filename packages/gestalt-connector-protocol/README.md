# Gestalt Connector Protocol

This package defines the canonical `Document` contract and the connector
interface used by Eudai Gestalt Integrations deployments.

## Schema evolution

`Document` schema `1.0` is frozen for 18 months after release. Compatible
changes may add optional fields with defaults. Breaking changes require a new
semantic schema version, a generated `docs/schemas/document.vN.json` artifact,
and a migration adapter from the previous supported version.
